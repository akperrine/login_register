# Login and Register

This is a simple application where a user can be created, and login to a basic interface.

## Dependencies

This project contains the SqlApi++ library, which is in turn dependent on lippq. Both libraries' binaries are contained within the project, but only for ARM-64 architecture. Appropriate binaries will be needed for other architectures.

## Goals

This is my attempt to something unfamiliar with something familiar and simple. With this simple project, the goals of this project are to build some familiarity with C++. Learning to work with cmake and libraries as well as basic familiarity of C++ are equally the goals of this project.
